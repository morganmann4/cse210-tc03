I was born in Fayetteville, Georgia but my current home is in Eagle, Idaho. An interesting thing about me is that I have a really impressive memory and can remember a lot of things that I read and watch. My favorite things I love to do is watching films, anime, and video games. I keep a list of all my favorite films, shows, and games. My favorite film franchises are Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe, MonsterVerse, Back to the Future, and Planet of the Apes. I currently have a major in Data Science and I served a mission in Utah from 2017 to 2019. I am in a family of 6, being the second oldest child with two sisters and one brother. I also have an awesome girlfriend whom I love hanging out with, and I love being a member of the church.
